This plugin provides screen-like keybindings for common window or buffer movements.  By screen-like, I mean that they are like the keybindings of the GNU screen(1) utility for multiplexing terminals.  <C-a><Space>, for example, will go to the next buffer.  <C-a>a will flip between the current and last-edited buffer.  <C-a>c will create a new buffer.  Other mappings are documented in the script itself.
